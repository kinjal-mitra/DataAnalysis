# DataAnalysis
Github doesn't support a lot of features of notebooks, such as interactive Plotly plots, and has faulty rendering in a number of ways. The projects in this repository has a lot of visualization in them which are not displayed by Github. <br>
To view the jupyter notebook with complete visualization, kindly use <a href="https://nbviewer.org/"> nbviewer.org</a>.
<br> The nbviewer link for each jupyter notebook is present in the README.md file in its respective folder.
